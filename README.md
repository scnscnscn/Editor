This version is derived from modifications made to the repository at [https://github.com/Cyberyzy/Hecto-windows-edition](https://github.com/Cyberyzy/Hecto-windows-edition), where several bugs have been fixed and additional features have been added. The original version had issues with cursor movement when inputting Chinese characters (Chinese characters typically occupy two character widths in the terminal), and pressing the down arrow key would cause the text following the cursor to move as well. This version has resolved these issues and specifies that files should be saved as `.txt` format. Additionally, there are still issues with searching for Chinese fields and naming files in Chinese, which will be addressed in future versions. There are also plans to add Chinese comments and the `Ctrl+Z` (undo) function at the appropriate time.
